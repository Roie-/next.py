# next.py (Basic Python Course)

#### Very simple and basic solution for 3 assignments:
- [x] 2.5 &#129138; hython.py (oop) :100:
- [x] 5.4 &#129138; id_check.py (Iterators+Generators+Exceptions) :100:
- [ ] 6.4 &#129138; connect_the_dots.py (Modules)

## Notes
The main purpose of the assignments is to check understanding of the material,
design of code and proper documentation, nothing more.
